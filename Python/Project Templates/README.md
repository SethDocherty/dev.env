## Why Should You Use This Template?

This template is the result of my years refining the best way to structure a project so that it is reproducible and maintainable. Integrated into this template are a suite of tools that I've used to aid in maintaining code quality, codebase dependencies and much more.

This template allows you to:

âœ… Create a readable structure for your project

âœ… Automatically run tests when committing your code

âœ… Enforce type hints at runtime

âœ… Check issues in your code before committing

âœ… Efficiently manage the dependencies in your project

âœ… Create short and readable commands for repeatable tasks

âœ… Automatically document your code

## Template Directory Structure

```bash

    â”œâ”€â”€ .vscode                            # Directory storing VSCode settings specific to the project  
    â”œâ”€â”€ config                             # Directory used to store configuration files

## How to use this Template

1. Clone **dev.env** repo down to your local machine if it hasn't already.
2. Open your command line tool of choice and change the Current Working Directory (CWD) to ***Python\Template Structure*** folder.

   > **ðŸ‘€ ProTip**: You can open PowerShell directly from the *Template Structure* folder in File Explorer by typing *PowerShell* in the address bar or `Shift + Right Click` in File Explorer.
   >
3. Running the following command to install a **cookiecutter** dependent python environment.

```PowerShell
poetry install
```

4. Next, activate the installed poetry environment by running the following command:

```PowerShell
poetry shell
```

5. To deploy the cookiecutter template run:

```PowerShell
cookiecutter .
```

You'll be asked a few questions which will be applied to settings up the project package.

> Note: The "." in the command `cookiecutter .` will reference the cookiecutter template and generate a project directory structure in the CWD. If you would like to specify where to generate output, pass in the `-o, --output-dir <PATH>` command option.

You will find a generated project directory where `{{ cookiecutter.__project_name }}` matches your input for the question, `project_name`. Navigate into that directory and reference the [Project README](./{{%20cookiecutter.__project_name%20}}/README.md) to continue setting up the project environment.

> Note: Don't forget to run the command `deactivate` to disable the poetry environment created in **step 3**.

## Static Code Analysis Tools

**Static Code Analysis Tools**, also known as *linters*, are tools that scan through your python codebase to identify possible issues. Think of it as an early warning system to speed up your development by pointing out problems that can be fixed during the development process rather than in the QA stage. The linting tools included in this template include:

- **[Black](https://github.com/psf/black)**: A code formatter to modify the style of your code (typically resolving around proper whitespace) without affecting the behavior of the program.
- **[Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)**: A type checker that verifies that your codebase follows its own type annotations aka type hints.
- **[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)**: An extremely fast error checker written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), that identifies syntax errors or other code that will result in unhandled exceptions and crashes. It's a replacement of [Flake8](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8) and many of it's plugins.
